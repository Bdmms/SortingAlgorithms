# SortingAlgorithms

Known Issues:
- The memory usage stated by the program is not accurate, however it is a pretty good estimate
- The timer used by the program is not accurate enough to provide consistent results
- As stated in the program, some algorithms are only useful if certain information is known about them (ex. min, max)
- Merge Sort will not work if the size is not a power of 2, additional code is required to make true merge sorting
